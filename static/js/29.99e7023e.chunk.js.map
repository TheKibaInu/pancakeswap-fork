You can't ignore block in TS at the moment https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51145180/how-to-use-ts-ignore-for-a-block\n * 2. Interpolations in keyframes are indeed supported and work fine https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/2263\n * But TypeScript definitions are not updated to reflect that - https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/48907\n * 3. Since this error is in the middle of a template string there is no way to add @ts-ignore on just that one line\n * without also messing prettier.\n *\n * I'll leave TODO: comment here to check back later if there is update to types\n *\n */\nimport styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components'\n\ninterface SliceProps {\n  length: number\n  offset?: number\n}\n\nexport const DrawAnimation = keyframes`\n  from {\n    stroke-dasharray: 0, 339.292\n  }\n  to {\n    stroke-dasharray: ${({ length }: SliceProps) => length} 339.292;\n  }\n`\n\nexport const OffsetAnimation = keyframes`\n  from {\n    stroke-dashoffset: 0\n  }\n  to {\n    stroke-dashoffset: ${(props) => -props.offset};\n  }\n`\n\nexport const SVG = styled.svg`\n  width: 128px;\n  height: 128px;\n  transform: rotate(-90deg);\n`\n\nconst DefaultSlice = styled.circle<SliceProps>`\n  fill: none;\n  stroke-width: 16;\n  stroke-dasharray: ${(props) => `${props.length} 339.292`};\n`\n\nexport const LostSlice = styled(DefaultSlice)`\n  stroke: #ed4b9e;\n  animation: ${DrawAnimation} 1s ease;\n`\n\nexport const WonSlice = styled(DefaultSlice)`\n  stroke: #31d0aa;\n  stroke-dashoffset: ${(props) => -props.offset};\n  animation: ${DrawAnimation} 1s ease, ${OffsetAnimation} 1s ease;\n`\n\nexport const Wrapper = styled.div`\n  position: relative;\n  width: 128px;\n  height: 128px;\n`\n\nexport const Info = styled.div`\n  width: 128px;\n  height: 128px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0;\n  top: 0;\n  z-index: 2;\n\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n`\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { useTranslation } from 'contexts/Localization'\nimport { Text } from '@pancakeswap/uikit'\nimport { SVG, WonSlice, LostSlice, Wrapper, Info } from './PnlChartStyles'\n\n/**\n * Bare minimum chart that doesn't require any external dependencies\n * For details read here - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/07/designing-simple-pie-charts-with-css/\n */\n\ninterface PnlChartProps {\n  won: number\n  lost: number\n}\n\n// 2 * Pi * R\nconst CIRCUMFERENCE = 339.292\n\nconst PnlChart: React.FC<PnlChartProps> = ({ lost, won }) => {\n  const { t } = useTranslation()\n  const percentageWon = ((won * 100) / (lost + won)).toFixed(2)\n  const paintLost = (lost / (won + lost)) * CIRCUMFERENCE\n  const paintWon = CIRCUMFERENCE - paintLost\n  return (\n    <Wrapper>\n      <SVG viewBox=\"0 0 128 128\">\n        <LostSlice r=\"54\" cx=\"64\" cy=\"64\" length={paintLost} />\n        <WonSlice r=\"54\" cx=\"64\" cy=\"64\" length={paintWon} offset={paintLost} />\n      </SVG>\n      <Info>\n        <Text small lineHeight=\"1\">\n          {t('Won')}\n        </Text>\n        <Text bold fontSize=\"20px\" lineHeight=\"1\">\n          {won}/{won + lost}\n        </Text>\n        <Text small lineHeight=\"1\" color=\"textSubtle\">\n          {percentageWon}%\n        </Text>\n      </Info>\n    </Wrapper>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default PnlChart\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { Price } from '@pancakeswap/sdk'\nimport { Flex, Text } from '@pancakeswap/uikit'\nimport { multiplyPriceByAmount } from 'utils/prices'\nimport { useTranslation } from 'contexts/Localization'\nimport { formatBnb } from '../helpers'\n\ntype SummaryType = 'won' | 'lost' | 'entered'\n\ninterface SummaryRowProps {\n  type: SummaryType\n  summary: any\n  bnbBusdPrice: Price\n}\n\nconst summaryTypeColors = {\n  won: 'success',\n  lost: 'failure',\n  entered: 'text',\n}\n\nconst summaryTypeSigns = {\n  won: '+',\n  lost: '-',\n  entered: '',\n}\n\nconst SummaryRow: React.FC<SummaryRowProps> = ({ type, summary, bnbBusdPrice }) => {\n  const { t } = useTranslation()\n\n  const color = summaryTypeColors[type]\n  const { rounds, amount } = summary[type]\n  const totalRounds = summary.entered.rounds\n  const roundsInPercents = ((rounds * 100) / totalRounds).toFixed(2)\n  const typeTranslationKey = type.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + type.slice(1)\n  const displayAmount = type === 'won' ?
